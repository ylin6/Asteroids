Asteroids

	For my Asteroid game, I have already generated the asteroids as an particle system. I have also loaded the space ship object and you can fly around space. I have also implemented collision detection and the game will end if you hit an asteroid. I now only need to add textures to make the game better looking, add menus for additional immersion, and gamify the program ( implement a score system, make it harder to avoid asteroids, etc). Furthermore, I would like to add an explosion particle system to show what happens if the spaceship hits an asteroid. 

	Please let me know if my game is too simple or tell me any additional ideas you have for my Asteroid game.
